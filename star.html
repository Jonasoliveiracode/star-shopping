            Wait right here (wait right here) <br>
            I'll be back in the mornin' (mornin') <br>
            I know that I'm not that important to you <br>
            But to me, girl, you're so much more than gorgeous (yeah) <br>
            So much more than perfect (yeah) <br>
            Right now, I know that I'm not really worth it <br>
            If you give me time, I can work on it <br>
            Give me some time while I work on it <br>

        Losin' your patience, and, girl, I don't blame you <br>
        The Earth's in rotation, you're waitin' for me <br>
        Look at my face when I fuck on your waist <br>
        'Cause we only have one conversation a week <br>
        That's why your friends always hatin' on me <br>
        Fuck 'em though, I did this all by myself <br>
        Matter fact, I ain't never asked no one for help <br>
        And that's why I don't pick up my phone when it ring

        None of my exes is over Lil Peep <br>
        Nobody flexin' as much as I be <br>
        That's why she text me and tell me she love me <br>
        She know that someday I'll be over the sea <br>
        Makin' my money and smokin' my weed <br>
        I think it's funny, she open up to me <br>
        Get comfortable with me, once I got it comin' <br>
        I love her, she love me 
    </p>

<section class="imagem" id="img02">
    <p>
        I know that I'm nothing like someone her family want me to be <br>
        If I find a way, would you walk it with me? <br>
        Look at my face while you talkin' to me <br>
        'Cause we only have one conversation a week <br>
        Can I get one conversation at least? <br>
        Shout out to everyone makin' my beats <br>
        You helpin' me preach <br>
        This music's the only thing keepin' the peace when I fall into pieces <br>
        Look at the sky tonight <br>
        All of the stars have a reason <br>
        A reason to shine, a reason like mine <br>
        And I'm fallin' to pieces 
    </p>
